# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet
![USGS Earthquake Image](readme_img/Leaflet1.PNG)

# Description
JSON data from the USGS on earthquakes from various regions across the globe were visualized on a graphical map.
The JSON repository for USGS URL: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.
Intensity of the earthquake was annotated by color coding and size of the circle marker. Clicking on any of the 
earthquake map data markers displays relevant data for that seismic event.
